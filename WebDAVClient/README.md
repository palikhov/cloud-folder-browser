# WebDAVClient

## About

Strongly-typed, async WebDAV Client implementation in C#.

WebDAVClient is based originally on <https://github.com/kvdb/WebDAVClient>. I've added Async support (instead of Callback), as well strong-types responses.

# Usage

``` csharp
// Basic authentication required
IClient c = new Client(new NetworkCredential { UserName = "USERNAME" , Password = "PASSWORD"});
// OR without authentication
var client = new WebDAVClient.Client(new NetworkCredential());

// Set basic information for WebDAV provider
c.Server = "https://dav.dumptruck.goldenfrog.com/";
c.BasePath = "/dav/";

// List items in the root folder
var files = await c.List();

// Find folder named 'Test'
var folder = files.FirstOrDefault(f => f.Href.EndsWith("/Test/"));
// Reload folder 'Test'
var folderReloaded = await c.GetFolder(folder.Href);

// Retrieve list of items in 'Test' folder
var folderFiles = await c.List(folderReloaded.Href);
// Find first file in 'Test' folder
var folderFile = folderFiles.FirstOrDefault(f => f.IsCollection == false);

var tempFileName = Path.GetTempFileName();

// Download item into a temporary file
using (var tempFile = File.OpenWrite(tempFileName))
using (var stream = await c.Download(folderFile.Href))
	await stream.CopyToAsync(tempFile);

// Update file back to webdav
var tempName = Path.GetRandomFileName();
using (var fileStream = File.OpenRead(tempFileName))
{
	var fileUploaded = await c.Upload(folder.Href, fileStream, tempName);
}

// Create a folder
var tempFolderName = Path.GetRandomFileName();
var isfolderCreated = await c.CreateDir("/", tempFolderName);

// Delete created folder
var folderCreated = await c.GetFolder("/" + tempFolderName);
await c.DeleteFolder(folderCreated.Href);
```
